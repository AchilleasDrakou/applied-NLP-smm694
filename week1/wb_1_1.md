Week 1 webinar, part 1/3
========================


Text and machines
=================

**How do machines think about text?**

+ answering this question is key to understand how to search for, retrieve, and
    edit patterns of text
+ regular expressions (regex) offer a possible framework to instruct machines to
    represent natural language as a mixture of formal expressions (next week,
    we'll go deeper into the rabbit hole)


Regular expressions as a pipeline
=================================

+ formally, a regular expression is an "algebraic notation for characterizing a
    set of strings" (Jurafski and Martin, 2008)
+ a key features of regex as and algebraic notation is the possibility to
    express fairly complex strings in relatively simple terms
+ regex can also be thought as a pipeline that connect the world of natural
    language (the one we, humans, speak) with the world of formal language (that
    is, the language f machines)
